Hello GitWorld, I'm a begginner coder just starting out in pursuing my BS in CompSci.
âš¡ I just finished my last GenEd course and am starting all my core curriculum. I haven't really touched code before this, but I have a passion for computers and modding.
  I have a tower I built by hand running all AMD, and dual-booting Windows 11 and ZorinOS for Ubuntu; and my Skyrim install has about 500 mods that I know how to make work together, but don't know how they work.
I want to someday build all kinds of programs, maybe even OS's and AI's.
ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning Python, don't know much about much else, but so far I  feel like i have knack for it and want to get my hands on some real world practice and application.
ðŸ“« I created a Discord along with my GitHub account because I noticed that a lot of communities use it. My tag is ghst_707.
